## üìå Project Focus

Develop a **mini web/PC game** or an **interactive simulation web tool/app** related to any aspect of **cities or urban environments**. Any city-related topic is acceptable.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

1. **Demo-ready**  
   - All projects must be demonstrable on the KB419 laptop during presentation day.  
   - **Web applications are strongly recommended** (accessible via URL).  
   - For complex setups (e.g., mobile apps or physical components), prepare a **standalone demo** that works on the classroom computer.

2. **Standalone Functionality**  
   - Projects must function independently and **not rely on other software platforms** (e.g., ArcGIS or Rhino).
