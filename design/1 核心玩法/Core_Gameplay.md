# Core Gameplay

## 1. Core Mechanics

### 🔁 Turn-Based Strategy
- The game is a **turn-based strategy** game centered on a **sandbox map**.
- Players engage in:
  - City construction  
  - Infrastructure development  
  - Logistics capacity allocation  
- Goal: Concentrate military forces in conflict zones for victory.

### 🕐 Turn Phases
- **Protected Phase (Turns 1–60)**: Mobilize resources but **cannot declare war**.  
- **Tension Phase (Turns 61–75)**: War declarations are allowed.  
- **War Resolution**: 3 turns after war declaration, **victory is determined**.

### 🔁 Core Loop
> City Construction → Railway Development → Military Buildup → Logistics Allocation → Army Mobilization

## 2. Sandbox Map Structure

### 🟡 Hexagonal Grid System
- Map is divided into **hexagonal grids**, each representing an administrative division.
- **Only one settlement** can be placed per grid.

### 🚆 Railway Network
- **Troop movements** must follow railways.
- Settlements **not connected** to conflict zones via railway **cannot contribute** troops.

---

## 3. Resource Management

### 💰 Primary Resources
- **GDP (Economic Output)**: Generated by settlements.
- **Military Manpower Pool**: Population grows uniformly per region (not infrastructure-dependent).

### 🎁 Regional Bonuses
- **20% GDP boost** if **all settlements** in a region are interconnected.

---

## 4. Administrative Hierarchy

### 🌍 Regions
- Max **4 settlements** per region.
- Conflict Zones: Specific regions for final battles (troop concentration required).

### 🏙 Settlement Tiers

| Tier        | Occupancy | Cost       | Build Time | Mobilization Rate | GDP/Turn  |
|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Village     | 1 grid    | 500,000    | 1 turn     | 50%                | 75,000    |
| Small City  | 2 grids*  | 1,500,000  | 1 turn     | 40%                | 200,000   |
| Metropolis  | 4 grids*  | 4,000,000  | 1 turn     | 30%                | 500,000   |

> *Upgrades require adjacent railway-connected grids.

## 5. Railway System

### 🚄 Railway Tiers

| Tier    | Transport Capacity | Upgrade Cost       | Speed               |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Level 1 | 1.6M population     | Base cost          | 5 grid segments/turn|
| Level 2 | 3.2M population     | Level 1 upgrade    | 5 grid segments/turn|

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Max **3 railway segments** can be built/upgraded **per region per turn**.

---

## 6. Military Mobilization & Upkeep

### 🪖 Mobilization Process

1. **Order Issued**: Troops generated based on region's population and mobilization rate.  
2. **Loading Phase (Turn 2)**: Troops begin boarding.  
3. **Transport Phase (Turn 3)**: Troops start moving via railways.

### 💸 Upkeep Costs

- **4 currency per soldier per turn**.
- If GDP is insufficient:
  - Troops **farthest from conflict zones** are removed.
  - GDP is reduced **proportionally**.

---

## 7. Victory Conditions

- Victory is resolved **3 turns after war declaration**.
- The side with the **greater total military strength** in conflict zones **wins**.
